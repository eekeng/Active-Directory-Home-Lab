<h1>Active Directory Home Lab</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
In this project, I configured an Active Directory Home Lab environment using Oracle VirtualBox. Firstly, I created a Domain Controller (DC) running Server 2019. On the DC, I installed Active Directory. I set up the network adapters, IP addressing, and the domain. Then I used NAT and routing to allow clients on the private internal network to connect to the external internet through the DC. Then I configured DHCP on the DC to automatically assign a client an IP address. Lastly, I used a PowerShell script to automatically create 1000 users in Active Directory to simulate a real work environment.

Next, I created a VM running Windows 10 that would act as a client computer in this environment. This machine connects to the private VirtualBox network. It is added to the DC's domain, and can be used to log into any of the 1000 users generated by the PowerShell script.
