<h1>Active Directory Home Lab</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
In this project, I configured an Active Directory Home Lab environment using Oracle VirtualBox. Firstly, I created a Domain Controller (DC) running Server 2019. On the DC, I installed Active Directory. I set up the network adapters, IP addressing, and the domain. Then I used NAT and routing to allow clients on the private internal network to connect to the external internet through the DC. Then I configured DHCP on the DC to automatically assign a client an IP address. Lastly, I used a PowerShell script to automatically create 1000 users in Active Directory to simulate a real work environment.

Next, I created a VM running Windows 10 that would act as a client computer in this environment. This machine connects to the private VirtualBox network. It is added to the DC's domain, and can be used to log into any of the 1000 users generated by the PowerShell script.

<h2>Walk-through:</h2>

<p align="center">
Set up an empty VM with no ISO installed. Navigate to settings and configure its network to have two network adapters. One will connect to the external public internet: <br/>

<br />
<br />
The other will connect to the internal private network.:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
Install Server 2019 ISO on the VM: <br/>

<br />
<br />
Navigate to Settings > Network & Internet > Change adapter options. Then rename the network adapter that connects to the external internet “INTERNET”, then name the other adapter which will connect to the internal network “internal”:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
Assign internal an IP address and subnet mask. Assign the DNS server to a loopback address.:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
Install Active Directory Domain Services:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
Create a domain:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
 Create and sign into a domain admin account:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
 Now we will set up routing and NAT to enable clients to connect to the internet through the Domain Controller. Install Routing and Remote Access on Server Manager:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
Configure and enable Routing and Remote Access with NAT. Choose the network adapter you named INTERNET:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
Next, Install DHCP on Server Manager:  <br/>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/NHMfwBW.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
<br />
<br />
In DHCP, set your IP range and subnet mask:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
Use your DC’s IP address as the router and use your DC as a DNS server:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
Open PowerShell ISE and run a script that generates 1000 random users.:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
Go back to Oracle VB and create an empty VM called client. Navigate to settings and change its network adapter to connect to the internal network. :  <br/>

<br />
<br />
Install Windows 10 ISO:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
After installing Windows 10, add the client to your domain:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
You can now sign into this client using any of the generated user accounts:  <br/>
